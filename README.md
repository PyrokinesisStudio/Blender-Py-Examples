# Blender-Snippets
Code tests with the Blender Python API

These are mostly Python script experiments and proof-of-concepts I wrote when testing out features for an add-on or to see how various Blender Python API functions work.

This code is intended to be run from Blender's script editor.

**Note:** these are not "snippets" in terms of the code-editor based [autocomplete functionality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3gLlZm-m_8). I was unaware of that popularised use of the term "snippets" when naming this repo. With that in mind, this repo will likely be renamed in the future to avoid possible confusion.
